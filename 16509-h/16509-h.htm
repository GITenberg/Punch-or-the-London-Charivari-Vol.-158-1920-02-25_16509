<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>"Another American," says a Washington despatch, "has been captured by
  Mexicans and is being held to ransom." We deplore these pin-prick
  tactics. If there is something about the United States that President
  <font class="sc">Carranza</font> wants changed he should say so.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A contemporary states that the old theory, that when your ears burn it
  means that people are talking about you, is accurate. Upon hearing this a
  dear old lady at once commenced to crochet a set of asbestos ear-guards
  for Mr. <font class="sc">Churchill</font>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The American gentleman who claims to have invented <i>revues</i> is
  shortly coming over to England for a holiday. Personally we should advise
  him to wait until the crime wave has died down a bit.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is pleasing to note that in spite of the recent spring-like weather
  the <font class="sc">Poet Laureate</font> is calmly keeping his head.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>In their last Note to Holland on the subject of the ex-Kaiser's trial
  the Allied Governments drop a hint that it was they and not Holland who
  won the War. It is impossible to be too definite on this matter.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Cotton, it is announced, has gone up to tenpence a reel. The new
  American whisky stands at the same figure.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Boys sing automatically, like parrots," declares the choirmaster of
  St. John's Church, Grimsby. His facts are wrong. The only thing automatic
  about a parrot is its bite.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>So thirsty were the Americans on board, it is stated, that on her
  homeward trip the <i>Mauretania</i> was drunk dry two days out. To remedy
  this unsatisfactory state of affairs a syndicate of wealthy Americans is
  understood to be formulating an offer to tow Ireland over to the New
  Jersey coast if a liquor licence is granted to the tug.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>There is no truth in the report that, as the result of a majority vote
  of the Dublin Corporation, the sword and mace have been replaced by a
  pistol and mitre.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We live in strenuous times. The <font class="sc">Mad Mullah</font> has
  been reported in action and Willesden has won the London Draughts'
  Tournament.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>By the way, those who remember the <font class="sc">Mad
  Mullah's</font> earlier escapades are of the opinion that it is high time
  for him to be killed again.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The <font class="sc">Home Secretary</font> hopes to introduce an
  Anti-Firearms Bill. Under this Act it is expected that it will be made
  illegal for criminals to shoot at people into whose homes they break.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A postcard posted in 1888 has just been delivered to <i>The Leeds
  Mercury</i>, and they ask if this is a record. Not a permanent one, if
  the Post Office can help it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A young lady told the Stratford magistrates that she gave up her young
  man because he said he was a millionaire, and she had later learned that
  he was a waiter. But there is nothing contradictory in this.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The ex-<font class="sc">Crown-prince</font> has written in the
  <i>Tägliche Rundschau</i> on "How I Lost the War." He pays a fine tribute
  to the British soldier, who, it appears, helped him to lose it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"How to Manage Twopenny Eggs" is the headline of a morning paper. A
  good plan is to grip them firmly round the neck and wring it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>An article in <i>Tit-Bits</i> tells readers how to make canaries pay.
  We have felt for some time that there must be a better method than that
  of suing the birds in the County Court.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Useful wedding-presents are now the vogue," says a weekly journal.
  Only last week we heard of a Scotsman who at a recent wedding gave the
  bride away.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"The Jolly Bachelors" is the title of a new club at Nottingham. No
  attempt has yet been made to start a Jolly Husbands' Club.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is gratifying to learn that the workman who last week fell from
  some scaffolding in Oxford Street, but managed to grasp a rope and hang
  on to it till rescued fifteen minutes later, has now been elected an
  honorary member of the Underground Travellers' Association.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A reader living in Hertfordshire writes to say that spring-like
  weather is prevailing and that a pair of bricklayers who started building
  about three weeks ago can now be seen daily sitting on three bricks which
  they laid last week.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>With such energy are the inhabitants of Leeds carrying out their
  campaign against rats that it is considered unsafe for any rodent under
  three years old to venture out alone after dark.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We are glad to learn that the Brixton lady who mislaid her husband
  last week at one of these West-End bargain sales has now received him
  back from the firm in fairly good condition.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>During the recent spell of warm weather several wooden houses threw
  out new shoots, some of which are already in bud.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We understand that the Government contemplate passing a Bill to forbid
  silver-weddings unless a larger percentage of alloy is used with
  them.</p>

    THE CRIME WAVE.

    <p><i>Crank</i> (<i>enlarging upon pet theory</i>). "<font class="sc">I
    tell you, Sir, we are all of us Bolshevists at heart. The only thing
    that's keeping you and me from a life of crime is the thought of the
    policeman round the corner.</font>"</p>

<h2>THE WOLF AND THE LAMB.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>An imaginary conversation.</i>)</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>[In his lecture at the Royal Institution, to which Mr. Punch recently
  referred, Mr. <font class="sc">Alfred Noyes</font> said that "our art and
  literature were increasingly Bolshevik, and if they looked at the columns
  of any newspaper they would see the unusual spectacle of the political
  editor desperately fighting that which the art and literary portions of
  the paper upheld."]</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font class="sc">Scene.</font>&mdash;<i>A Club-room near Fleet Street.
  The</i> Political Editor <i>and the</i> Literary Editor <i>of "The Daily
  Crisis" are discovered seated in adjoining armchairs</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Political Editor.</i> Excuse me, but haven't I seen you
  occasionally in <i>The Crisis</i> office?</p>

  <p><i>Literary Editor.</i> Possibly. I look after its literary pages, you
  know.</p>

  <p><i>P.E.</i> Really? I run the political columns. Did you read my
  showing-up this morning of the Bolshevik peril in the House of Lords?</p>

  <p><i>L.E.</i> I'm afraid I never read the political articles. Did you
  notice my two-column boom of young Applecart's latest book of poems?</p>

  <p><i>P.E.</i> No time to read the literary columns, and modern poetry's
  as good as Chinese to me. Who's Applecart?</p>

  <p><i>L.E.</i> My dear Sir, is it possible that you are unfamiliar with
  the author of <i>I Will Destroy</i>? He's the hope of the future as far
  as English poetry is concerned.</p>

  <p><i>P.E. (cheerfully).</i> Never heard of him. What's he done?</p>

  <p><i>L.E. (impressively).</i> He has overthrown all the rules, not only
  of art, but of morality. He has created a new Way of Life.</p>

  <p><i>P.E.</i> Can't see that that's anything to shout about. What's his
  platform, anyway?</p>

  <p><i>L.E.</i> Platform? To anyone who has tho slightest acquaintance
  with Applecart the very idea of a platform is fantastic. He doesn't
  stand; he soars.</p>

  <p><i>P.E.</i> Well, what are his <i>views</i>, then? Pretty tall, I
  suppose, if he's such a high flier.</p>

  <p><i>L.E.</i> You may well say so. In the first place he discards all
  the old artistic formulæ.</p>

  <p><i>P.E.</i> I know; you write a solid slab of purple prose, scissor it
  into a jig-saw puzzle, serve it with a dazzle dressing and call it the
  New Poetry.</p>

  <p><i>L.E.</i> Have your joke, if you will. But, more important still,
  Applecart is a rebel against humanity and all its fetishes, social,
  ethical and political.</p>

  <p><i>P.E. (startled).</i> A Bolshie, I suppose you mean?</p>

  <p><i>L.E.</i> The artist is proof against all these vulgar terms of
  abuse, culled from the hustings. Call him a Pussyfoot as well; you cannot
  shake him from his pinnacle.</p>

  <p><i>P.E.</i> Yes, but look here&mdash;he's just the sort of pernicious
  agitator we're out against in <i>The Crisis</i>&mdash;at least in my
  department. My special article this morning&mdash;three thickly-leaded
  columns&mdash;actually revealed the existence of a most insidious plot to
  undermine the restraining influence of the House of Lords by the spread
  of Bolshevik propaganda masquerading as literature. You see, there's a
  certain section of the Lords, mainly new creations who've only recently
  been released from various employments, who now for the first time in
  their lives have leisure for reading; then there's the spread of
  education among the sporting Peers. Well, these people are ready to
  succumb to all sorts of poisonous doctrines, if they're served up in what
  I presume to be the fashionable mode of the moment; and I expect your
  precious Applecart is one of the Bolsh agents who are laying the trap.
  You'll have to stop booming him, you know. He's not doing the paper any
  good.</p>

  <p><i>L.E.</i> My dear Sir, literature takes no account of the fads and
  fancies of party politics. And I gather from you that party politics have
  no use for literature except from a propagandist view. Let us be content
  to go our own ways in peace.</p>

  <p><i>P.E.</i> Yes, that's all very well for you and me, but what about
  the Chief? How does he reconcile these absolutely conflicting
  standpoints? And what does the public think of it all?</p>

  <p><i>L.E. (confidentially).</i> Between you and me, the Chief knows his
  public. And the public knows its papers. The last thing it wants from us
  is consistency, which is always boring. Besides (<i>still more
  confidentially</i>), the public doesn't take us quite so seriously as we
  like to pretend.</p>

  <p><i>P.E.</i> H'm, maybe you're right. As a matter of fact (<i>lowering
  his voice</i>) I sometimes think I'm a bit of a Socialist myself.</p>

  <p><i>L.E.</i> Really? As for me (<i>conspiratorially</i>), I adore <font
  class="sc">Tennyson</font>, and <font class="sc">Ezra Pound</font> fills
  me with a secret wrath. Still, the public&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>P.E.</i> Ah, the public&mdash;! Have a drink?</p>

<h2>THE COWARD.</h2>

  <p>Cecilia was knitting by the fire.</p>

  <p>"What on earth have you two been doing?" she asked as we came in.
  "John looks as if he'd been in a boiler explosion."</p>

  <p>"Hardly that," I said. "We've been playing with Chris&mdash;haven't
  we, John?"</p>

  <p>John gasped.</p>

  <p>"No, we haven't," he said. "On the contrary, <i>they</i> have been
  playing with <i>me</i>, Cecilia."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's all the same thing, isn't it?" said Cecilia. "Anyhow, I
  heard <i>you</i> making a most frightful row."</p>

  <p>"Of course I was making a row. So would you make a row if people
  suddenly mistook you for a Teddy Bear or something and started bunging
  you about the room."</p>

  <p>"I haven't the least idea what you're talking about," said Cecilia,
  "but I think you're being intensely vulgar."</p>

  <p>"Vulgar! 'Vulgar,' she says." He laughed bitterly. "You'd be vulgar
  too if you'd had that great hulking brute" (he pointed at me) "sitting on
  the small of your back, and a hooligan of a boy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Cecilia sat up and took notice.</p>

  <p>"Hooligan!" she said, "Hooligan! Who's a Hooligan?"</p>

  <p>"Sh! sister," I murmured. "You'll strain the epiglottis."</p>

  <p>John turned on me savagely.</p>

  <p>"You keep quiet. It isn't your epi&mdash;epi&mdash;what you
  said&mdash;and, anyway, can't I even have a quiet row with my own wife
  without&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"John, calm yourself," said Cecilia crushingly. "Alan, tell me what
  you've been doing."</p>

  <p>"Yes," muttered John, "tell her." He subsided into an armchair.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "you see, Christopher and I were up in the nursery and
  getting on quite all right when John butted in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I simply opened&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"John, keep quiet," said his wife. "Well, Alan?"</p>

  <p>"Well, the fact is, Chris and I were in the middle of a great war with
  all his soldiers. I had just firmly established fire superiority and was
  actually on the verge of launching a huge offensive&mdash;the one that
  was going to win the war, in fact&mdash;when, as I said, in butted this
  great clumsy elephant and knocked half of Christopher's army over."</p>

  <p>"Purely an accident," said John.</p>

  <p>"<i>Will</i> you keep quiet, or must I make you?" asked Cecilia.</p>

  <p>"Well, of course," I went on, "finding ourselves suddenly attacked by
  a common foe, Chris and I naturally joined forces to defend
  ourselves."</p>

  <p>"Defend!&mdash;" shrieked John. "No, I won't keep quiet another
  second. Defend! Why, they rushed at me like a couple of wild hyenas."</p>

  <p>"My dear John," said Cecilia, "<i>you</i> attacked them first, and of
  course they defended themselves as best they could."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," I said.</p>

  <p>"After all, John," said Cecilia, "you ought to be glad your son is so
  ready to look after himself, instead of calling him a hooligan. You're
  always shouting about the noble art of self-defence."</p>

  <p>"Noble art of self-defence <i>rot</i>," said <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg 145]</span> John. "There's nothing in
  the noble art about pushing lead soldiers down a man's neck."</p>

  <p>"Down your neck?" said Cecilia.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said John. "I keep trying to tell you and you won't let me.
  That brute sat on the small of my back while Christopher pushed 'em down.
  The little beasts all had their bayonets fixed, too."</p>

  <p>Cecilia and I laughed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, laugh," said John bitterly. "It <i>is</i> funny that our child
  should be growing up a Bolshevist; trying to flay his own father. He'll
  be setting fire to the cat in a week and then you'll have another
  laugh."</p>

  <p>"John," shrieked Cecilia, "how dare you? If you say another word about
  the darling&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The door opened and Christopher came into the room.</p>

  <p>He seemed to have washed his face or something. Anyway, he looked
  quite a little angel and that's hardly&mdash;however.</p>

  <p>"I shall tell Chris what you've been saying," said Cecilia.</p>

  <p>John jumped.</p>

  <p>"No, no, Cecilia," he said in a strangled voice. "Don't betray me.
  I&mdash;I'm sorry; I withdraw everything. Cecilia, save me. Think of our
  courting days; remember&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Christopher," said Cecilia clearly, "you see your father? Go and pull
  his last remaining hairs out."</p>

  <p>Christopher looked at her in amazement. Then he walked over to John,
  climbed on his knee and put an arm round his neck.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't hurt you, dear old Dad, would I?" he asked affectionately,
  looking at his mother in pained surprise.</p>

  <p>John positively gasped with relief.</p>

  <p>"Dear old Chris," he said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you hypocrite!" said Cecilia.</p>

  <p>"Coward!" said I.</p>

  <p>I was sitting on one of those dumpy hassock sort of things. John
  looked down at me vindictively for a moment and then a horrid smile
  started spreading about his nasty face.</p>

  <p>"Christopher," he said very gently, "wouldn't it be a good thing if we
  pushed Uncle Alan over and knocked his slippers off, and then I'll sit on
  him while you tickle his feet?"</p>

  <p>Now it sounds silly, but a cold prespiration came over me. Being
  tickled is so hopelessly undignified. And, anyhow, I simply can't stand
  it on the feet.</p>

  <p>"John," I said severely, "don't be absurd."</p>

  <p>Christopher gurgled.</p>

  <p>"He's afraid," he said. "Come on, Dad."</p>

  <p>I saw that they really meant it, and I can only suppose that I was
  carried away by one of those panics that you read of as attacking the
  bravest at times. Anyhow, quite suddenly I found myself moving rapidly
  round the table, out of the door and up the stairs. Halfway up I stopped
  to listen. Cecilia and John were laughing loudly and coarsely and
  Christopher was chanting "Uncle's got the wind up" in a piercing treble.
  Not at all a nice phrase for a small boy to have on his tongue.</p>

  <p>It was all very galling for one who has fought and, I may say, bled
  for his country. I almost decided to go back and fight if necessary. Then
  I heard a stage-whisper from Christopher:</p>

  <p>"Let's creep upstairs after him and tickle him to death. Shall we,
  Dad?"</p>

  <p>Sheer hooliganism. It was impossible to fight with honour against such
  opponents. I disdained to try. I went hastily up the remaining stairs and
  locked myself in my room.</p>

<h2>THE INTERNATIONALIST.</h2>

  <p>"What on earth," I said to the waiter, who was standing a few yards
  off, lost in a pensive dream of his native land&mdash;Switzerland,
  France, Italy?&mdash;well, anyhow, lost in a pensive dream&mdash;"what on
  earth is a Petrograd steak?"</p>

  <p>The white napkin whisked like the scut of a rabbit, and he bounded to
  my side. "Eet is mince-up," he said melodramatically. "Ze Petrograd steak
  ver good. Two minute&mdash;mince-up."</p>

  <p>"But isn't that a Vienna steak?" I asked.</p>

  <p>A spasm of pain passed over his face. "Before ze War," he whispered,
  "yes, Vienna steak. Now we call it ze Petrograd. You vill have one? Yes?
  Two minute."</p>

  <p>Memories came flooding back of that moment of crisis which had found
  so many of our trusted statesmen ill-prepared, but, terrible as it was,
  had not caught the managers of London restaurants napping. I remembered
  the immense stores of Dutch lager beer which they had so providentially
  and so patriotically held in anticipation of the hour of need. Dutch
  beer, both light and dark, so that inveterate drinkers of Munich and
  Pilsener were enabled to face Armageddon almost without a jerk. They had
  other things ready too&mdash;Danish <i>pâté de fois gras</i>, Swiss liver
  sausages, Belgian pastries and the rest. It was in that dark hour, I
  suppose, that the Vienna steak set its face towards the steppes. But this
  was in 1914, and a good deal had happened since then. It appeared to me
  that the restaurant was not exactly <i>au courant</i> with international
  complications and the gastronomic consequences of the Peace. I felt
  entitled to further illumination.</p>

  <p>"I don't feel at all certain," I told the man, "that I ought to eat a
  Petrograd steak. Is it a white steak?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, no, not vite, not vite at all," he assured me. "Eet is
  underdone&mdash;not much, but a little underdone. Ver good mince-up."</p>

  <p>"I absolutely refuse to eat a Red Petrograd steak," I declared. "Have
  you by any chance anything Jugo-Slavian on the menu?"</p>

  <p>"Zere is ze jugged hare&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I think you misunderstand me," I interrupted; "this is a point of
  principle with me. Supposing I consume this Czecho-Slovakian mince-up and
  then have a piece of Stilton; there has been no war with Stilton, I
  fancy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ver good, ze Stilton," interjected the chorus.</p>

  <p>"And coffee&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"Turkish coffee?" he said.</p>

  <p>"There you go again," I grumbled. "Whatever my attitude may be towards
  Vienna and Petrograd (and, mind you, I am not feeling at all bitter
  towards Vienna), my relations with Turkey are most certainly
  strained."</p>

  <p>"No, not strained, ze Turkish coffee," he cried eagerly; "eet has ze
  grounds."</p>

  <p>"So have I," I told him; "we will call it the Macedonian coffee. It is
  you who insisted in obtruding these international relations on my simple
  lunch, and I mean to do the thing thoroughly. Better a dish of Croat
  Serbs where love is than a bifteck Petrograd&mdash;Never mind, go and get
  the thing."</p>

  <p>When he returned with it I fell to, but my thoughts remained with the
  waiter. What a man! With his dispassionate judgment, his calm sane
  outlook on men and affairs, shaken a little perhaps in 1914, but since
  then undisturbed, was he not cut out above all others to settle the vexed
  frontier lines of Europe? I wondered whether Lord <font class="sc">Robert
  Cecil</font> might not possibly make use of him. I was tempted to try him
  still further.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever heard of Mr. J.M. <font class="sc">Keynes</font>?" I
  asked him when he brought me the Bessarabian coffee.</p>

  <p>"Mr. <font class="sc">Keynes</font> I not know. He not come here, I
  zink."</p>

  <p>"Or the Treaty of London?"</p>

  <p>"I vill ask ze manager."</p>

  <p>"Or President <font class="sc">Wilson</font>?"</p>

  <p>A brilliant smile of illumination lit up his features.</p>

  <p>"American, is he not?" he said. "Ver reech, ze Americans."</p>

  <p>This saddened me a little. He was not then absolutely complete. There
  was a faint tarnish on the lustre of his innocence. He was scarcely
  perhaps suited for the League of Nations after all. Lighting an Albanian
  cigarette I asked him for my bill.</p>

<h2>COX AND BOX.</h2>

  <p><font class="sc">My dear Charles</font>,&mdash;Let us talk <i>Haute
  Finance</i>. In other words, let us indulge in that good old Anglo-Saxon
  pastime of blackguarding <font class="sc">Cox and Co</font>. It will
  remind us of the piping days of war. There is too much peace about, and
  the gentle and ever-forgiving <font class="sc">Cox and Co</font>. expect
  their customers to be men of force and character, showing temper from
  time to time. Everybody else may be demobilised; I remain a soldier, and
  as such I have my special bank. Ah, me! the battles in Charing Cross are
  not the easy things they used to be. No longer, as of old, I come fresh
  to the attack against a mere underling, worn down by the assaults of wave
  after wave of brother-officers attacking, before me. I enter the
  Territorial Department alone and am taken on by a master-hand, supported
  and flanked by a number of unoccupied subordinates. About the Spring of
  1925, when I expect to be the only "T" left, I anticipate the decisive
  moment when I shall cross swords or swop bombs with Sir <font
  class="sc">Cox</font> himself. Having bravely encountered "<font
  class="sc">and Co</font>." these many years, I shall not be daunted by
  that gilded knight.</p>

  <p>The war having once put me in possession of my <font class="sc">Cox
  and Co</font>., I had very frequent recourse to them when in need of such
  solace as only money can bring. The time arrived when I applied in vain;
  the money had disappeared. Though I had no reason to suspect <font
  class="sc">Cox and Co.</font> of being dishonest I noticed a tone of
  assuredness and self-complacency in their letters strangely similar to
  that in my own, and I <i>knew</i> that I was being dishonest, so I
  demanded to see my pass-book. It was a horrid sight, and it gave me
  seriously to think. How came it that the side of the book which showed my
  takings was so clear and easily to be understood, but the side which
  showed their takings wrapt in mystery and hieroglyphics such as not even
  the world's leading financiers and mathematicians could hope to unravel?
  My subaltern, being consulted, agreed with me; I would have had him
  carpeted by the C.O. at once if he hadn't.</p>

  <p>I stepped round to <font class="sc">Cox and Co.</font> and had it out
  with them verbally. After a discussion lasting half-an-hour, it was shown
  that I had been credited with a week's pay to which I wasn't entitled and
  that a month's income-tax, to which a grasping Government <i>was</i>
  entitled, had not been deducted. I left the building ninety-three
  shillings worse off than I entered it.</p>

  <p>I gave <font class="sc">Cox and Co.</font> six months to go wrong in,
  and then called for that pass-book again. My eye fell upon a paying and
  deducting and refunding and readjusting of an item itself so shameful
  that it dared only appear under its initials. Why this oscillation? I
  asked myself. So we engaged upon another correspondence, and another
  interview took place, at which I was supported by my subaltern (who could
  multiply and add), and the bank-man was supported by a young lady (who
  could divide and subtract). At the end of a passionate discussion, which
  lasted fifty-seven minutes (forty-five of them being after closing time)
  the conclusion was arrived at that the total was correct to a halfpenny.
  Even <font class="sc">Cox and Co.</font> themselves were a bit surprised
  at that.</p>

  <p>Years passed, and there was no doubt about it; the money continued to
  disappear. Trusting that <font class="sc">Cox and Co.</font> were now
  lulled into a feeling of false security I tried a surprise
  reconnaissance. I dropped in on them without warning and asked to see
  that pass-book then and there. They searched high and low, but they
  couldn't find it. I, on the other hand, found it quite easily, when I
  searched amongst my papers at home. To me this proved that I was the
  better searcher. My subaltern, however, would have it that the
  circumstances gave me no right of action against <font class="sc">Cox and
  Co.</font> His sympathies were clearly with them, so I requested him
  kindly to get on with his own work and not to interfere further in my
  private affairs. He went away in a huff, got demobilised and, I have
  little doubt, married the young lady who divided and subtracted and, with
  her, set up a bank of his own. I devoted my young life to the search for
  some person, firm or corporation, expert in pass-books, haughty of
  demeanour, capable of getting blood out of a stone and not likely to give
  even the devil his due; I wanted such an ally for the next assault.</p>

  <p>I have always remained a civilian, and as such have retained my other
  banker. A man of unlimited possessions, I may state accurately that I
  have to-day no fewer than two banks of my own. Let us call this other one
  Box and Co. That is not the real name, but it is as far as I dare go to
  refer to them, even under an assumed name. Years of stern handling by
  them have taken all the spirit out of me. It is as much as I can do to
  screw up my courage so far as to ask the loan of a pound or two of my own
  money off them. And there have been times, in the pre-1914 past, when I
  have felt it would be better to go without money than to have the stuff
  thrown at me, shovelled at me in that contemptuous offhand manner. I now
  repaired in person to the premises of Box and Co., with their handsome
  marble façade and their costly mahogany fittings, and had a word with Mr.
  Box himself. A little artful flattery, a few simple lies and just a touch
  of ginger in the matter of professional competition, and Box and Co. were
  brought into the war. I handed them <font class="sc">Cox and Co.</font>'s
  pass-book and told them that now was their time to go in and win.</p>

  <p>I used to look in every other day to see how the struggle went. At
  first Box and Co. were confident, remarking on my wisdom in placing
  myself (and my pass-book) in such competent hands as theirs. But as the
  correspondence went on their enthusiasm wore off; Mr. Box gave vent to
  observations reflecting ill on the Army system of pay, on the Army
  itself, even on that part of it which was me. Had it not been that the
  pride of Box and Co. was involved, I believe they would have gone to
  London in a body, there to form a lifelong friendship with <font
  class="sc">Cox and Co.</font>, out of pure fellow-feeling. But I have
  hinted that Box and Co. were a cold inhuman institution, whose business
  in life it was to do people down, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"
  id="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span> or go down itself. And so <font
  class="sc">Cox and Co.</font> had to be for it. Eventually, in the late
  winter of 1919, Box and Co. extracted from <font class="sc">Cox and
  Co.</font> the admission that a five had been mistaken for a three, and I
  had been done out of twopence, an affair all the more gross in that it
  had happened as long ago as the early spring of 1915, and never a word of
  remorse meanwhile! A conclusion by which neither Box nor <font
  class="sc">Cox</font> was really satisfied, but which, for me, was
  enough. We English may only win one battle in a war, but that battle is
  the last.</p>

  <p>Possibly, my dear Charles, you have a soft spot in your heart for this
  <font class="sc">Cox and Co.</font>, never failing in courtesy and
  attention and ever heaped with abuse? So, to be frank, have I. Let us
  turn round and blackguard the other fellow. The sequel is incredible.</p>

  <p>I next handed my Box and Co. pass-book to <font class="sc">Cox and
  Co.</font>, giving them a brief and touching <i>résumé</i> of my sad
  story of wrong and oppression, and bidding them do their damnedest in
  their turn. They wrote to Box and Co.: "Our customer, your customer, we
  may say <font class="sc">the</font> customer, Second-Lieutenant,
  Brevet-Lieutenant, Temporary Captain, Acting Major, Local Colonel,
  Aspiring General (entered in your books as plain Mister) Henry
  Neplusultra, informs us that, though he has banked with you since the
  first sovereign he earned at his baptism, he has been so frowned at and
  scorned as to have been rendered morally unable to handle his current
  balance. He instructs us...."</p>

  <p>But why relate the story in all its grim horror? Enough to say that so
  successfully did <font class="sc">Cox and Co.</font> pursue their
  instructions that they discovered a credit balance in my favour of
  14<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; so politely and firmly did they conduct the
  correspondence that eventually Box and Co. burst into tears, admitted the
  claim and, upon my calling the other day personally to receive
  satisfaction, handed me the 14<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> with a deferential
  bow. If you doubt the truth of this statement you have only to come round
  to my place, where you can see for yourself the threepence, which is
  still in my possession.</p>

<h2>DAY BY DAY IN THE WORLD OF CRIME.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By a well-known Professor of Larceny.</i>)</p>

  <p>In these days when robbery with violence is an everyday occurence, few
  people will trust themselves alone in railway carriages. Imagine,
  therefore, my surprise, not unmingled with pleasure, on seeing a somewhat
  pompous-looking individual, with the circumference and watch-chain of the
  successful merchant, sitting alone in a first-class carriage on the
  suburban up-line from Wallingford. I always travel from Wallingford, as
  it is the one station on the line at which you are not required to show a
  ticket on entry. Accordingly I entered the old gentleman's carriage, took
  his ticket, and offered him a cigarette, which he accepted. I then opened
  the conversation.</p>

  <p>"I wonder you wear your watch-chain so prominently," I remarked,
  "especially during the present vogue of crime&mdash;so tempting, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he said, "so you may think; but, being a bit of a criminologist,
  I have arranged that as a little trap. It is my belief that the
  pickpocket, foiled in one particular, never attempts to rob his victim in
  any other way. Now this chain cost me precisely ninepence. It is weighted
  at each end with a piece of lead, which gives an appearance of
  genuineness to the watch-pocket. I am heavily armed, in case he should
  attempt violence."</p>

  <p>It was here that I removed his pocket-book and slipped it into my
  great-coat. Not daring to examine it openly, I fingered it cautiously,
  and felt the stiff softness of bank-notes. I was so carried away with
  pleasure that I was quite surprised to hear his voice returning from a
  distance.</p>

  <p>"As for my ticket," he continued, "that is a single from Wallingford
  to the next station, Sadlington; it is two years old. My season I keep
  inside the lining of my hat."</p>

  <p>It was here that I returned the ticket to his pocket. After all, I
  reflected, I could pay at the other end with a very small portion of the
  contents of the pocket-book, which I reckoned must contain at least
  half-a-dozen fivers.</p>

  <p>"By the way," he added, "I have a passion for biscuits; will you join
  me in one?" and he proffered a small tin. "I eat so many of them," he
  said, "that I can write all my memoranda on the slips of paper from the
  tins, and these I keep in my pocket-book. My money I keep next my
  season."</p>

  <p>It was here that I returned the pocket-book.</p>

  <p><i>Monday, February 16th.</i>&mdash;The great <font
  class="sc">Auckland</font> still reposes a touching faith in the
  Profiteering Act. In his opinion it "has had a stabilising effect on the
  price of clothing;" by which he means, I suppose, that West-End tailors
  long ago nailed their high prices to the mast-head.</p>

  <p>In commending the Bill for the continuance of D.O.R.A., a
  <i>remanet</i> from last Session, the <font
  class="sc">Attorney-General</font> was almost apologetic. He laid much
  stress upon the "modest and attenuated form" which the measure now
  presented, and the short time it was to remain in force. Serious
  objection was taken by the Irish Members to the provision that in
  districts where a proclamation is in force the D.O.R.A. regulations,
  instead of coming to an end on August 31st, will continue for a year
  after the end of the War. This they naturally interpreted as a means of
  continuing the military government of Ireland, a country in which,
  according to Mr. <font class="sc">Devlin</font>, the Government had as
  much right as the Germans in Belgium. The House, however, seemed to agree
  with the Irish Attorney-General that in the present state of Ireland it
  would not be wise to dispense with the regulations, and gave the Bill a
  second reading by 219 votes to 61.</p>

  <p>Then the House turned to the discussion of the levy on capital. The
  <font class="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</font> was still inexorably
  opposed to a general levy, but would like a toll on war-wealth alone, and
  proposed to set up a Committee to consider whether it was practicable.
  Mr. <font class="sc">Adamson</font> frankly declared that the Labour
  Party was in favour of a capital levy, but wanted to get at the
  war-profits first. Mr. <font class="sc">Chamberlain</font> objected to
  widening the scope of the inquiry on the ground that it would take too
  long, and also that uncertainty would promote extravagance and discourage
  saving. And, despite Lieut.-Commander <font class="sc">Kenworthy's</font>
  naïve suggestion that we should restore credit by making a bonfire of
  paper-money&mdash;he did not say whose&mdash;the House agreed with the
  <font class="sc">Chancellor</font>.</p>

    <p>COLONEL AMERY CRUSOE RETURNS FROM A SUCCESSFUL DAY WITH HIS MAN
    FRIDAY.</p>
  </div>
  <p><i>Tuesday, February 17th.</i>&mdash;The Acting Colonial Secretary
  bubbled over with delight as he described the success of the operations
  against the Somaliland dervishes. The principal credit was due to the
  Royal Air Force, but the native levies had also done their part
  effectively. The only fly in Colonel <font class="sc">Amery's</font>
  ointment was the escape of that evasive gentleman, the <font
  class="sc">Mullah</font>, to whom he was careful on this occasion not to
  apply the epithet "Mad." As, however, the <font class="sc">Mullah</font>
  has lost all his forces, all his stock and all his belongings, it is
  hoped that it will be at any rate some time before he pops up again.</p>

  <p>The Coal Mines Bill was wisely entrusted to Mr. <font
  class="sc">Bridgeman</font>. Lord <font class="sc">Spencer</font> once
  delighted the House of Commons by announcing that he was "not an
  agricultural labourer"; and Mr. <font class="sc">Bridgeman</font>
  similarly put it in a good temper by admitting that he had never himself
  worked in a mine. But he showed quite a sufficient acquaintance with his
  subject, and succeeded in dispelling some of the fog that enshrouds the
  figures of coal-finance. The miners, of course, objected to the Bill on
  the ground that it was not nationalisation, but were left in a very small
  minority.</p>

  <p>A Private Members' debate on the Housing Problem occupied the evening.
  There was much friendly criticism of the <font class="sc">Minister of
  Health</font>, for whom Major <font class="sc">Lloyd Greame</font>
  suggested a motto from the <i>Koran</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4">"This life is but a bridge;</p>
      <p>Let no man build his house upon it."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But the lapse of time is gradually bringing performance nearer to
  promise, and Dr. <font class="sc">Addison</font> was able to announce
  that over one hundred thousand houses were now "in the tender stage." Let
  us hope no bitter blast will nip them in the bud.</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, February 18th.</i>&mdash;The Lords returned to work
  after their week's holiday in a rather gloomy mood. By some occult
  process of reasoning Lord <font class="sc">Parmoor</font> has convinced
  himself that the distress in Central Europe is largely the fault of the
  Peace Conference. He was supported by Lord <font class="sc">Bryce</font>,
  who declared that the "Big Four" approached the business of Treaty-making
  in a German rather than an English spirit (which sounds as if he thought
  they never meant to keep it), and by Lord <font
  class="sc">Haldane</font>, who, <i>more suo</i>, accused the negotiators
  of having shown "no adequate prevision." Lord <font
  class="sc">Crawford</font> dealt pretty faithfully with the cavillers and
  pointed out that this country had already spent twelve millions on
  relieving European distress, and was prepared to spend nearly as <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg 154]</span> much
  again when the United States was ready to co-operate; but at present, he
  reminded them, that country was still in a state of war with Germany.</p>

  <p>The one bright spot of the sitting was Lord <font
  class="sc">Hylton's</font> statement that the National Debt, which was
  within a fraction of eight thousand millions on December 31st, had since
  been reduced by eighty-five millions. The pace is too good to last, but
  it is something to have made a start.</p>

  <p>For nearly four years we have been anxiously waiting to know what
  really did happen at the battle of Jutland. The voluminous efforts of
  Admirals and journalists have failed to clear up the mystery, and even
  Commander <font class="sc">Carlyon Bellairs</font> has not satisfied
  everybody so completely as himself that his recent work reveals the
  truth. But now the official history is on the eve of publication and Mr.
  <font class="sc">Long</font> no longer feels it necessary to keep the
  secret. Here it is in his own words: "The <i>moral</i> of the German
  fleet was very seriously shaken." What a relief!</p>

  <p>It seems that the Turks were informed in advance of the intention of
  the Peace Conference to let them stay at Constantinople in the hope that
  they would forthwith abandon their sanguinary habits. Instead of which
  they appear to have said to themselves, "What a jolly day! Let us go out
  and kill something&mdash;Armenians for choice." So now a further message
  has been sent to them to the effect that the new title to the old
  tenement is not absolute but conditional, and that one of the covenants
  forbids its use as a slaughterhouse.</p>

    <p><i><font class="sc">Mr. Austen Chamberlain</font></i> (<i>as
    Sidesman</i>). "<font class="sc">The threepenny-bit is economical,
    perhaps; but a desirable coin, from my point of view, it is
    not.</font>"</p>
  </div>
  <p>A modest little Bill empowering the Mint to manufacture coins worth
  something less than their weight in silver aroused the wrath of Professor
  <font class="sc">Oman</font>. The last time, according to his account,
  that the coinage was thus debased was in the days of <font
  class="sc">Henry VIII.</font>, whose views both on money and matrimony
  were notoriously lax. Other Members were friendly to the project, and Mr.
  <font class="sc">Dennis Herbert</font>, in the avowed interest of
  churchwardens, urged the Government to seize the opportunity to abolish
  the threepeeny-bit, the irreducible minimum of "respectable" almsgiving.
  The <font class="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</font>, however, stoutly
  championed the elusive little coin, for which he declared there was "an
  immense demand."</p>

  <p>On Captain <font class="sc">Hambro's</font> motion deploring the
  action of certain trade-unions in refusing to admit ex-Service men to
  their ranks the Labour Party heard some very straight talking. The whips
  of Lady <font class="sc">Bonham-Carter</font> at Paisley were nothing to
  the scorpions of ex-Private <font class="sc">Hopkinson</font>, who has
  actually been fined at the instance of the trade-unions because he
  insisted upon employing some of his old comrades-in-arms.</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Sexton's</font> rather maladroit attempt to shift
  the blame on to the employers only deepened the impression that
  trade-unionism is developing into a system of caste, in which certain
  occupations are reserved for certain people. Only an elect bricklayer,
  for example, may lay bricks&mdash;though anybody can heave them&mdash;and
  the mere fact that a man has shouldered a rifle in the service of his
  country in no way entitles him to carry a hod.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, February 19th.</i>&mdash;The impending advent of a Home
  Rule Bill is greatly perturbing the little remnant of Irish Nationalist
  Members, threatened with the extinction of their pet grievance. Although
  but seven in number they made almost noise enough for seventy.
  Question-time was punctuated with their plaints. The <font
  class="sc">Chief Secretary</font> did his best to soothe them, but his
  remark that "no man in Ireland need be in prison if he will obey the law"
  poured oil on the flames.</p>

  <p>Despite the reduction of the Question-ration from eight to four per
  Member, the House collectively grows "curiouser and curiouser." This is
  partly due to the popularity of <font class="sc">Premier</font>-baiting,
  now to be enjoyed on Mondays and Thursdays. In future, Members are to be
  further restricted to three Questions <i>per diem</i>; but no substantial
  relief is to be hoped for until the House sets up its own censorship,
  with power to expunge all Questions that are trivial, personal or put for
  purposes of self-advertisement. Not many&mdash;a dozen or two daily,
  perhaps&mdash;would survive the scrutiny.</p>

<h2>DEAD SEA FRUIT.</h2>

  <p>To-day the telephone has been installed. The members of our staff are
  going about their duties in a dazed fashion, and I, to whose
  single-handed tenacity the achievement is due, find myself unable in
  these first full moments of triumph to concentrate on my every-day
  affairs.</p>

  <p>I can still remember that fresh summer morning when with springy step
  I set out to call upon the District Contract Agent for the first time.
  Innocently enough I expected to arrange for the installation of a
  telephone within the next two or three days. But I recollect that as I
  ascended the steps of his premises I became depressed by that House of
  Usher foreboding, and then, when I witnessed the way in which an
  imperturbable official discomfited a tempestuous gentleman who was giving
  tongue to a long list of his wrongs, my carefully rehearsed and resolute
  address shrivelled on my lips <span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"
  id="page155"></a>[pg 155]</span> and I found myself asking tamely for a
  form.</p>

  <p>This form, <i>plus</i> the information that telephones were more
  speedily installed where ex-Service men were employed, was the net result
  of my first encounter.</p>

  <p>And now, as I turn in reminiscent mood to a dusty file, I pause before
  one of my early letters to the District Contract Agent: "... If you saw
  our staff, who are without exception ex-soldiers, you would say at once
  that they are a remarkably fine body of men and deserving of a telephone.
  They mark their possessions with their initials in indelible pencil.
  Between them they have seen service on every front, from Mespot to
  Ireland. Some have been mentioned in despatches, many have figured in
  Cox's Book of Martyrs, and our cashier <i>says</i> that he once opened a
  tin of bully with the key provided for that purpose. One of our juniors,
  Major Bays Waller, O.B.E., who came to us from a Control Office and who
  advises us on our filing, says that it is like coming from a home to a
  home. You must come round and have a chat with him; you would have
  <i>so</i> much in common.</p>

  <p>"Trusting that you will expedite the little matter of our telephone
  installation, and assuring you that the spirit of our staff continues to
  be excellent, etc...."</p>

  <p>Although this letter was signed "Henry Thomas, James &amp; Sons," the
  District Contract Agent's vague reply on the file before me commences:
  "Sir (or Madam);" and I feel now, as I did then, that it is not in the
  best of taste for him to brag as he does about his telephone and his
  "Private Branch Exchange" on the very paper on which he writes to baffled
  applicants for installation.</p>

  <p>From this time the correspondence is marked by an increasing
  bitterness on my side and a level colourlessness on his. Only once did he
  assume the offensive, which took the shape of a demand for four pounds
  for possible services to be rendered at some period in the future. At
  Yuletide I hoped that "during this season of goodwill he would see his
  way to give instructions for the installation of our telephone," and in
  the New Year I played once more the ex-Service employees'
  card:&mdash;"... Whatever views you may hold on the policy of the
  withdrawal of British troops from Russia, we are convinced that you will
  sympathise with our desire to extend a hearty welcome to a member of our
  staff on his return to this office from Murmansk; and we feel that, since
  he served with the R.E. Signals, it would be a graceful compliment to him
  if we had the telephone installed. We therefore cordially invite your
  co-operation so that this may take place before his arrival.... The idea
  of installing a telephone in this office is not in itself a novel one, as
  you may recollect that the suggestion has cropped up in the
  correspondence that has passed between us...."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>And now, as I have said, the telephone is installed. The instrument is
  fashioned in a severe style (receiver and mouth-piece mounted on an
  ebonite column of the Roman Doric Order), and it stands for all to see as
  a symbol that in the seclusion of our offices we are in touch with the
  world at large. But as a symbol only it must remain, for the voices of
  the outer world that call us up as they search for other friends or
  obstruct us when we in turn are, as it were, groping after ours, have
  already frayed the temper of our staff. It was inevitable that under such
  constant irritation these ex-Service men of ours would one day burst into
  strong military idiom, so we have disconnected our telephone in order to
  avoid the calamity of losing our lady-typist.</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p class="center">"<font class="sc">Just Like Judy.</font>"</p>

  <p>If the author of <i>Just Like Judy</i> will look into that commodious
  classic, <i>Mrs. Beeton's Cookery Book</i>, he will find a formula for
  light pastry. And if he will proceed to the (for him) enlivening
  adventure of essaying a tartlet, he will find that most fatal among a
  host of fatal errors will be any failure to preserve the due proportion
  of ingredients. I do not suggest that there is as rigid a formula for
  light comedy. But certainly Mr. <font class="sc">Denny</font> threw in
  too many unnecessary mystifications and crude explanations in proportion
  to the wit, wisdom and lively incident of his confection. In particular
  he was constantly making some of his characters tell the others what we
  of the audience either already knew or quite easily guessed. To exhaust
  my tedious-homely metaphor, if you put in a double measure of water the
  mixture will refuse to rise. And that I imagine is essentially what
  happened to <i>Just Like Judy</i>.</p>

  <p>Irish <i>Judy</i>, a charmingly pretty busybody, outwardly just like
  Miss <font class="sc">Iris Hoey</font>, comes to <i>Peter Keppel's</i>
  studio and hears that this casual youth has got into a deplorable habit
  of putting off his marriage with her friend <i>Milly</i>. She
  (<i>Judy</i>) will see to that! She assumes the <i>rôle</i> of a
  notorious Chelsea model, whom proper <i>Peter</i> has never seen.
  <i>Peter</i> knocks his head on the mantelpiece, just where a shrapnel
  splinter had hit him, and is persuaded that she, <i>Judy McCarthy</i>,
  affecting to be <i>Trixie O'Farrel</i>, is his wife. It all seems very
  horrible to him, but, shell-shock or no shell-shock, he sets to work to
  paint her portrait in a business-like way, and at the end of four hours
  it doesn't seem at all horrible. And by the time it is explained that it
  was all a joke (some people do have such a nice sense of humour) he is
  all for rushing off to the registry-office, <i>Judy</i> agreeing.</p>

  <p>Not that <i>Judy</i> is a minx. She did her level best to make two
  people who obviously didn't love one another fulfil their engagement,
  instead of, like a sensible woman, accepting the inevitable, which was,
  as it happens, so congenial to her. What puzzled me was <i>Peter's</i>
  indignation with poor <i>Milly</i> when he found that she really didn't
  love him (but, on the contrary, a bounder called <i>Crauford</i>), yet
  couldn't bear to cause him unhappiness, and was sacrificing herself for
  him. As that was his attitude precisely, I suppose he felt annoyed by
  this lack of originality. If we men are like that, it wasn't nice of Mr.
  <font class="sc">Denny</font> to give us away.</p>

  <p>At any rate I am sure Mr. <font class="sc">Donald Calthrop</font>
  didn't believe in <i>Peter</i> all the time. When he did he was very good
  indeed. When he didn't he was horrid. Did Miss <font class="sc">Iris
  Hoey</font> believe in <i>Judy</i>? I am not so sure. I suspect not. Did
  I believe in either? I did not.</p>

  <p>I was a little surprised that Miss <font class="sc">Joan
  Vivian-Rees</font> should so overplay her <i>Trixie</i>. Her work is
  certainly in general not like that, and I conjecture the influence of
  some baleful autocrat of a producer. It seemed to me that Miss <font
  class="sc">Mildred Evelyn's</font> <i>Milly</i> was, all things
  considered, a capable and consistent study of a desperately unsympathetic
  character, a more difficult and creditable feat than is commonly
  supposed.</p>

  </div>
  <p>I should hesitate to accuse Mr. <font class="sc">Ronald Jeans</font>
  of originality in the design of his musical trifle at the Comedy. The
  idea of a company of women that bans the society of men is at least as
  old as the Attic stage. But it is to his credit that though the theme
  invited suggestiveness he at least avoided the licence of <i>The
  Lysistrata</i>. Indeed there were moments when his restraint filled me
  with respectful wonder. Thus, though the Pacific Island to which the
  Junior Jumper Club retired&mdash;with no male attendant but the Club
  porter&mdash;clearly indicated a bathing scene, yet we had to be
  satisfied with an occasional glimpse of an exiguous <i>maillot</i> with
  nobody inside it.</p>

  <p>In fact, the fun throughout had a note of reserve and was never
  boisterous. Mr. <font class="sc">Jack Buchanan's</font> quiet methods in
  the part of the <i>Hon. Bill Malcolm</i>, universal philanderer, lent
  themselves to this quality of understatement. In a scene where he tried
  to extricate himself from a number of coincident entanglements with
  various members of the Club he was quite amusing without the aid of
  italics. Mr. <font class="sc">Gilbert Childs</font>, again, as
  <i>Weekes</i>&mdash;Club porter and <i>Admirable Crichton</i> of the
  island&mdash;though a little broader in his style, was too clever to
  force the fun.</p>

  <p>The other sex, as was natural with women who affected a serious
  purpose, had fewer chances, and Miss <font class="sc">Phyllis
  Monkman</font> spoilt hers by a bad trick of hunching her shoulders and
  waggling her arms as if she were out for a cake-walk on Montmartre.</p>

  <p>There were touches of humour in Mr. <font
  class="sc">Cuvillier's</font> tuneful music and in the limited movements
  of the best-looking chorus that I have seen for a long time.</p>

  <p>As for the plot, it had at least the merit of continuity and conformed
  to the logic, seldom too severe, of this kind of entertainment, as
  distinct from the so-called <i>revue</i>. Nearly everything was well
  within my intelligence, the chief exception being the title; for never
  surely did a wild-goose chase offer such easy sport. The birds were just
  asking to be put into the bag. I should myself have preferred, out of
  compliment to the chorus, to call the play "Wild Ducks," only, of course,
  <font class="sc">Ibsen</font> had been there before. Not that this would
  have greatly troubled an author who showed so little regard for the
  proprietary rights of <font class="sc">Aristophanes</font> and Sir <font
  class="sc">James Barrie</font>.</p>

<h3>THE INCORRIGIBLE.</h3>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Ernest was a sprightly youth</p>
      <p>With a passion for the truth,</p>
      <p>Who, the other day, began</p>
      <p>His career as midshipman.</p>
      <p>'Twas not in the least degree</p>
      <p>Vulgar curiosity</p>
      <p>Urging him to ask the reason</p>
      <p>Why, both in and out of season;</p>
      <p>'Twas but keenness; all he lacked</p>
      <p>Was a saving sense of tact.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Once the Lieut. of Ernie's watch,</p>
      <p>Dour, meticulous and Scotch,</p>
      <p>Thought he'd show the timid snotty</p>
      <p>(Newly joined) exactly what he</p>
      <p>Wanted when inspecting men.</p>
      <p>Closely Ernest watched, and then</p>
      <p>Said, saluting, "Sir, I note</p>
      <p>Several creases in your coat,</p>
      <p>And I see upon your trouser</p>
      <p>Signs of paint-work; yet just now, Sir,</p>
      <p>Did you not think fit to blame</p>
      <p>One poor man who had the same?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Ere that outraged Lieut. replied</p>
      <p>Suddenly our hero spied</p>
      <p>Coming aft, his labours done,</p>
      <p>Our benignant Number One</p>
      <p>(<i>Most</i> abstemious is he,</p>
      <p>And, in fact, a strict T.T.,</p>
      <p>But&mdash;it shows how Fate can blunder&mdash;</p>
      <p>No one could be rubicunder.</p>
      <p>Ernest, after one swift glance,</p>
      <p>Said, "Excuse my ignorance,</p>
      <p>But, Sir, can you tell me why</p>
      <p>You are always red, while I,</p>
      <p>Even when I drink a lot,</p>
      <p>Only flush if I am hot?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Just as Number One grew pale</p>
      <p>And collapsed against the rail,</p>
      <p>Striving grimly not to choke,</p>
      <p>Ernest heard the busy Bloke</p>
      <p>Calling loudly, "Let her go!"</p>
      <p>To a seaman down below;</p>
      <p>"Fool! the cutter's bound to ram you,</p>
      <p>Push the pinnace forrard, damn you!"</p>
      <p>Ernest shook his youthful head</p>
      <p>And he very gently said</p>
      <p>Into his Commander's ear,</p>
      <p>"You forget yourself, I fear.</p>
      <p>May I ask what you would do</p>
      <p>If I used that word to <i>you</i>?</p>
      <p>Is it worthy, Sir, of an</p>
      <p>Officer and gentleman?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Aft ran little Ernest, only</p>
      <p>Pausing when he saw a lonely</p>
      <p>Figure bright with golden lace</p>
      <p>Who appeared to own the place.</p>
      <p>"Ah!" thought Ernie, "I know you;</p>
      <p>You're the luckless Captain who</p>
      <p>(Though you hadn't then a beard)</p>
      <p>Most unwillingly appeared</p>
      <p>But a year ago or less</p>
      <p>In the Illustrated Press."</p>
      <p>"Tell me, Sir," the youngster cried,</p>
      <p>Crossing to the Captain's side</p>
      <p>Of the sacred quarterdeck&mdash;</p>
      <p>"How did you contrive the wreck</p>
      <p>Of the cruiser you commanded</p>
      <p>When she bumped the beach and stranded?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>You may say, "He is so brave he</p>
      <p>Ought some day to rule the Navy."</p>
      <p>Certainly he <i>ought</i>, but still</p>
      <p>I'm afraid he never will;</p>
      <p>For they talked to him so gruffly</p>
      <p>And they handled him so roughly</p>
      <p>That, when he was fit to drop</p>
      <p>And the kindly Bloke said, "Stop!</p>
      <p>Or you'll make him even madder;</p>
      <p>He is wiser now and sadder,"</p>
      <p>Ernest simply answered, "Ay, Sir,</p>
      <p>You have <i>made</i> me sad; but why, Sir?"</p>

<h3>ÆQUAM MEMENTO.</h3>

  <p>"I wonder," said Mary for the third time, "if we shall catch the tram
  at the other end."</p>

  <p>"Calmness," I told her&mdash;this for the second time&mdash;"is the
  essence of comfortable travel. Meeting trouble half-way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It isn't half-way," she said indignantly. "We're nearly there."</p>

  <p>We were on a bus whose "route" terminated some five miles from home,
  which we proposed to reach by a tram, and, the hour being late, it was
  our chances of catching a car that were worrying Mary.</p>

  <p>"Never get flurried," I went on. "If people would only go ahead calmly
  and steadily.... What causes half our traffic congestion? Flurry. What
  makes it so difficult to move quickly in the streets? Flurry. What is it
  clogs the wheels of progress everywhere?"</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me," she implored. "Let me guess. Flurry."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," I said, and at this point we reached our terminus. Two
  trams were waiting, one behind the other, some thirty yards away, and, as
  we descended the steps of the bus, the bell of the first one rang
  warningly. Mary would have started running, but I detained her.</p>

  <p>"Flurrying again," I said indulgently. "Here are two trams, but of
  course you must have the first one, however full it is," and I led her
  towards the second. As I expected, it was quite empty, and I was still
  using it to point my moral when its conductor began juggling with the
  pole. It was then that I realised that, though on the down lines, this
  car was going no further. It was, in fact, turning round for its journey
  back to London, while in the distance the rear lights of our last down
  tram seemed to wink a derisive farewell.</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it but to go ahead calmly and steadily, and we
  did so. It was somewhere about the end of the fourth mile that Mary asked
  suddenly:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What was it you said clogged the wheels of progress everywhere?"</p>

  <p>"Flurry," I said feebly.</p>

  <p>"Well, <i>I</i> think it's blisters," she said.</p>

<h3>FILM NOTES.</h3>

  <p>Those who are still inclined to question whether the cinema is to be
  regarded as a serious force in the realm of Art should not only read the
  frequent contributions to <i>The Times</i> and other newspapers on this
  department of the drama, but should bear in mind that quite recently it
  has been stated that both the Rev. <font class="sc">Silas K.
  Hocking</font> and Mr. <font class="sc">Jack Dempsey</font> have taken
  part in photo-plays. It cannot be doubted that the peculiar talent
  required for making the heart of the people throb is being revealed in
  the most unlikely places.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>If proof were needed that the art of the film is a dangerous rival to
  that of the stage, we would point to the five-reel drama, <i>The Call of
  the Thug</i>, of which a private trade view was given last week. Miss
  Flora Poudray, who is here featured&mdash;her name is new to
  us&mdash;proves to be a screen actress of superb gifts. We have seen
  nothing quite so subtly perfect as her gesture of dissent when the
  villain proposes that he and she together should strangle the infant heir
  to the millionaire woollen merchant on the raft during the thunder-storm.
  Patrons of the cinema will do well to look out for this delicate yet
  moving passage. The film will be released as early as November, 1921.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p>The publishers of <i>Peter Jackson: Cigar Merchant</i> (<font
  class="sc">Hutchinson</font>) seem in their announcements to be
  desperately afraid lest anyone should guess it to be a War book. It is,
  they suggest, the story of the flowering of perfect love between two
  married folk who had drifted apart. It is really an admirable epitome of
  the War as seen through one pair of eyes and one particular temperament.
  I don't recall another War novel that is so convincing. The almost
  incredible confusions of the early days of the making of K.'s army; the
  gradual shaping of the great instrument; the comradeship of fine spirits
  and the intrigues of meaner; leadership good and less good; action with
  its energy, glory and horror; reaction (with incidentally a most moving
  analysis of the agonies of shell-shock and protracted neurasthenia) after
  the long strain of campaigning&mdash;all this is brought before you in
  the most vivid manner. Mr. <font class="sc">Gilbert Frankau</font> writes
  with a fierce sincerity and with perhaps the defects of that
  sincerity&mdash;a bitterness against the non-combatant which was not
  usual in the fighting-man, at least when he was fighting; or perhaps it
  was only that they were too kind then to say so. Also as "one of us" he
  is a little overwhelmed by the sterling qualities of the
  rank-and-file&mdash;qualities which ought, he would be inclined to
  assume, to be the exclusive product of public-school playing-fields. I
  haven't said that <i>Peter Jackson</i> gave up cigars and cigarettes for
  the sword, and beat that into a plough-share for a small-holding when the
  War was done. A jolly interesting book.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I found the arrangement of <i>The Clintons and Others</i> (<font
  class="sc">Collins</font>) at first a little confusing, because Mr. <font
  class="sc">Archibald Marshall</font>, instead of keeping his
  <i>Clinton</i> tales consecutive, has mixed them democratically with the
  <i>Others</i>. Our first sight of the family (and incidentally the most
  agreeable thing in the volume) is provided by "Kencote," a
  brightly-coloured and engaging anecdote of Regency times, and of the
  plucking of an honoured house from the ambiguous patronage of the First
  Gentleman in Europe. I found this delightful, spirited, picturesque and
  original. Thence we pass to the <i>Others</i>, to the theme (old, but
  given here with a pleasant freshness of circumstance) of maternal craft
  in averting a threatened mésalliance, to a study of architecture in its
  effect upon character, to a girls' school tale; finally to the portrait
  of a modern <i>Squire Clinton</i>, struggling to adjust his mind to the
  complexities of the War. This last, a character-study of very moving and
  sympathetic realism, suffers a little from a defect inherent in one of
  Mr. <font class="sc">Marshall's</font> best qualities, his gift for
  absolutely natural dialogue. The danger of this is that, as here in the
  bedroom chatter of the Squire's daughters, his folk are apt to repeat
  themselves, as talk does in nature, but should not (I suppose) in art.
  Still this is a small defect in a book that is sincere in quality and
  convincingly human in effect. <i>The Clintons and Others</i> is certainly
  miles away from the collections of reprinted pot-boilers that at one time
  brought <span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg
  160]</span> books of short stories into poor repute. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Marshall</font> and Others (a select band) will rapidly
  correct this by giving us in small compass work equal to their own
  best.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Shuttered Doors</i> (<font class="sc">Lane</font>) is what you
  might call a third-and-fourth-generation story&mdash;one of those books,
  so rightly devastating to the skipper, in which the accidental turning of
  two pages together is quite liable to involve you with the
  great-grandchildren of the couple whose courtship you have been perusing.
  Observe that I was careful to say the "accidental" turning, though I can
  picture a type of reader who might soon be fluttering the pages of
  <i>Shuttered Doors</i> in impatient handfuls. The fact is that Mrs. <font
  class="sc">William Hicks Beach</font> has here written what is less a
  novel than a treatise, tasteful, informed and sympathetic, on county life
  and manners and houses. The last of these themes especially has an
  undisguised fascination for her. When <i>Aletta</i>, the chief heroine,
  was left pots of money by a Dutch uncle (who was so far from filling his
  proverbial <i>rôle</i> that he hardly talked at all) she spent it and her
  enthusiasm, indeed her existence, in restoring two variously dilapidated
  mansions&mdash;Graythorpes, her husband's home, and Doller Place, left
  her by an appreciative aunt. When not thus employed she would be reading
  a paper on Homes (given here <i>in extenso</i>), or comparing those of
  other persons with her own. I don't want you to get the impression that
  <i>Shuttered Doors</i> is precisely arid; it is too full of ideas and
  vitalities for that; but it does undoubtedly demand a special kind of
  reader. Incidentally, Mrs. <font class="sc">Hicks Beach</font> should
  revise her chronology. For <i>Aletta</i>, who was married at twenty-eight
  and died at sixty-two, to have had at that time a grandson on the staff
  of the Viceroy of India, he must have received his appointment before the
  age of fifteen&mdash;which even in these experimental days sounds a
  little premature.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Do not allow yourself to be misled by the fact that the portrait on
  the paper cover of <i>Maureen</i> (<font class="sc">Jenkins</font>) does,
  I admit, remarkably suggest a lady whose mission in life is the
  advertisement of complexion soap. You probably know already that the
  methods of Mr. <font class="sc">Patrick Macgill</font> are made of
  sterner stuff. This "Story of Donegal," which I have no intention of
  giving in detail, is the history of the course of true love in an Irish
  village, full of types which, I dare say, are realistically observed;
  verbose in places to an almost infuriating degree (not till page 61 does
  the heroine so much as put her nose round the scenery), but working up to
  a climax of considerable power. <i>Maureen</i>, I need hardly say, was as
  fair as moonrise, but suffered from the drawback of an irregular origin,
  which took the poor girl a great deal of living down. Nor need I specify
  the fact that most of the male characters in the district are soon
  claimants for her hand. Really this is the plot. Having betrayed so much,
  however, nothing shall persuade me to expose the bogie scenes on the
  midnight moor, where the villain combines his illicit whiskey manufacture
  with his courtship, and where finally the three protagonists come by a
  startling finish. <i>Maureen</i> is not a story that I should recommend
  save for readers with abundant leisure; but those whose pluck and
  endurance carry them to the kill will certainly have their reward.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>In <i>Memories of a Marine</i> (<font class="sc">Murray</font>)
  Major-General Sir <font class="sc">George Aston</font> records for us,
  cosily and anecdotally, a life spent in service, not only of the active
  kind&mdash;in Egypt and South Africa&mdash;but also as a Staff College
  Professor, and, more intriguingly, as an expert in Secret Intelligence in
  the cloisters of Whitehall or up and down the Mediterranean. If his book
  is not so sensational in the matter of revelations as the current fashion
  requires, it has a restful interest all its own, varied here and there
  with some very attractive stories. To give just one example, the author,
  when setting out to co-ordinate the work of various authorities in a
  certain harbour, found a signal buoy, a torpedo station, a fixed mine and
  a boom, each under separate control, all included in the defences. But
  the torpedo could not be launched unless the buoy were first cleared
  away, and the mine, if fired, would blow up the boom. One would have
  welcomed more of this sort of thing, for the truth is that even
  restfulness may be overdone and discretion become almost too admirable.
  Occasionally too the writer enlarges a little on&mdash;well, he enlarges
  a little, as anyone would with half his provocation. Still, for all
  comrades of his service, at any rate, every word he has written will be
  of interest; and perhaps he does not really mind so much about the
  general public, though he has had the good sense to crown his work with
  an apposite quotation from <i>Punch</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>The Specials</i> (<font class="sc">Heinemann</font>) is the story
  of the Metropolitan Special Constabulary, and it would have been a
  thousand pities if it had not been told. Colonel <font class="sc">W.T.
  Reay's</font> book will stand as a record of invaluable service performed
  by a devoted body of men, service for which the whole nation&mdash;and
  London in particular&mdash;has every reason to be grateful. If I
  understand Colonel <font class="sc">Reay</font> rightly he doesn't wish
  bouquets to be thrown at the Specials, but he would not, I think,
  discourage me from saying that they performed dangerous and ticklish work
  with unfailing resource and tact. All of us know that they desire no
  other reward for their services than the satisfaction of having done
  their duty; but our gratitude demands to be heard; and I for one take
  this occasion to trumpet forth the "All clear" signal with feelings of
  affectionate pride.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>If <i>By Way of Bohemia</i> (<font class="sc">Skeffington</font>) is a
  fair sample of Mr. <font class="sc">Mark Allerton's</font> work I have
  been missing a number of very readable stories. His hero, <i>Hugh
  Kelvin</i>, a journalist (they must be rare) who had no very good conceit
  of himself, married a barmaid, and she ran his house as if it were a
  third-class drinking saloon. She was one of those women who for want of a
  better word we call impossible; but she found <i>Hugh</i> as
  unsatisfactory as he found her. In the circumstances the union had to be
  dissolved, and, although I suspect Mr. <font class="sc">Allerton's</font>
  tongue of being very near his cheek when he contrived <i>Hugh's</i>
  escape from a life of sordid misery, I admit that his solution of the
  difficulty is cleverly told. And, after all, coincidences do happen in
  real life, and it would be unfair to Providence to suppose that they were
  not put there for a useful purpose.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
